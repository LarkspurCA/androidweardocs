Android Wear Demand
********************

The Demand context is one of the core functions for Android Wear. A demand is displayed as a large icon, typically when you swipe a displayed suggestion. You tap on an icon to perform the desired demand.

The Android Wear Preview app demonstrates this core function for messages. When new email arrives, you swipe to the left to scroll through the demand icons: open, reply, and archive.
