Android Wear Demand
********************

The Demand context is one of the core functions for Android Wear. A demand is displayed as a large icon, typically when you swipe a displayed suggestion. You tap on an icon to perform the desired demand.

The Android Wear Preview app demonstrates this core function using message notifications. When new email arrives, you swipe to the right to scroll through the available demand icons: open, reply, and archive.
