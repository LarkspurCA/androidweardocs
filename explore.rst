How Does Android Wear Work?
===========================

The easiest way to learn how Android Wear works is to install the Android Wear Preview app on your Android phone and and try it out. For now, we have to use an Android Wear emulator instead of an actual Android Wear device to see how it works. 

The Android Wear Preview app displays all phone notifications on the emulator. You can swipe the screen up or down to scroll through the list of notifications, swipe right to delete a notification, or swipe left to select a demand icon. The functionality is fairly basic at this point, but it is a good stepping off point for more interesting examples later.

To try out the Android Wear Preview, perform the following tasks:

* Sign up for the `Android Wear Developer Preview <http://developer.android.com/wear/preview/start.html>`_.

  After you receive your confirmation email, you can install the Android Wear Preview Application and download the support library and code samples.

* Install the `Android Studio Preview <http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html>`_.

  To try out the preview app, you anly need the Android Tools. However it is much easier to install a full IDE than indivicual components. You can use either Eclipse or Android Studio as your IDE, but I recommend Android Studio because Google uses it now and the sample applications are Studio projects.

* Set up an Android Wear emulator. See `Android Wear Developer Preview <http://developer.android.com/wear/preview/start.html>`_ for the necessary procedures:

  * Install the Android Wear system image using the SDK Manager.

  * Set up and start an Android Wear emulator using the AVD Manager.

* Install the Android Wear Preview app on your smartphone.

  You can swipe vertically to scroll through the notifications, swipe to the right to delete the current notification, and sweep to the left to view available demands. The notifications depend on the activity on your own smartphone, so experiment to see how Android Wear works for you.

You are now up and running with Android Wear, and ready to move on to more interesting examples. The preview includes three example projects you can try next.
