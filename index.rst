Welcome to Android Wear Docs!
=============================

**What is Android Wear?**

Android Wear is the new Google API for smart watches and other wearable devices. These wearables work in conjunction with an Android smartphone to put useful information at your fingertips. The first devices that support Android Wear are the Moto 360 and LG G watches, which will be available this summer. The Android Wear development tools are available now however, and this site is devoted to helping developers get started. We are hoping to learn more about Android Wear at the upcoming Google I/O conference.

If you are new to Android Wear you first need to learn the capabilities of wearable apps and how they work with Android smartphones. Then you can move on to developing your own custom app.
