**What is Android Wear?**

By Michael Hahn, December 2014

Android Wear is the Google API for smart watches, Google Glass, and other wearable devices. These wearables work in conjunction with an Android smartphone to put useful information at your fingertips. The first Android watches were the Motorola 360,  LG's G watch, and the Samsung Gear Live. Now a new generation of watches are becoming available, including the Sony SmartWatch 3, that provide full GPS and other features like offline music. This means you can now use the watch for common activities, like exercise or navigation, even when it is not paired with your phone. More wearables are coming soon, all of which address the limitations of early devices.

Android 4.4 (KitKat) for handheld and wearable devices was introduced at Google I/O 2014, along with an Android Studio version that included features specific to wearables. Since then, Google has released Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and Android Studio 1.0,

The first devices to take advantage of Lollipop are Android watches. Users can now choose from a wider array of watch faces, and developers can add watch faces that support their app. Besides just displaying time in an interesting way, the watch face can now display app information like upcoming appointments. 

If you are new to Android Wear you first need to learn how to present timely and concise information on the small screen of a wearable, and then become familiar with the software and tools that make it all possible. This site helps developers quickly work through the basic concepts and develop their first wearable app.
