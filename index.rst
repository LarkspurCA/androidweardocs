**What is Android Wear?**

Android Wear is the new Google API for smart watches and other wearable devices. It works in conjunction with an Android smartphone to put useful information at your fingertips.
The first devices that support Android Wear are the Moto 360 and LG G watches, which will be available this summer. The Android Wear development tools are available now however, and this site is devoted to helping developers get started.

Initially, you need to become familiar with the UI core functions, Suggest and Demand.
