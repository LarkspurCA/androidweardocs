**What is Android Wear?**

By Michael Hahn, February 2017

Android Wear 2.0 is the latest Google software for smart watches and other wearable devices. It includes a complete redesign of the user interface and significantly expands the capabilities when the watch is not paired with the phone, even normal cellphone calls. Along with the Apple smart watch, wearables have crossed the tipping point of just being a consumer plaything to an integral part of work and play.  

If you are new to Android Wear software development, you need to learn how to present timely and concise information on the small screen of a wearable, and also become familiar with the software and tools needed for applicaiton development. This site helps new developers quickly develop their first wearable app. If you are interested in developing apps for the Apple Watch, see http://www.applewatchdocs.com.
