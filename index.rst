**What is Android Wear?**

By Michael Hahn, July 2014

Android Wear is the Google API for smart watches, Google Glass, and other wearable devices. These wearables work in conjunction with an Android smartphone to put useful information at your fingertips. The first Android watches are LG's G watch and the Samsung Gear Live watch, both of which are available now. The Moto 360 watch is expected later this summer. New Android software for handheld and wearable devices was released to the developers at Google I/O 2014, along with an Android Studio update that includes features that are specific to wearables. This new software completely replaces the Android Wear Preview software that was available earlier.

If you are new to Android Wear you first need to learn how to present timely and concise information on the small screen of a wearable, and then become familiar with the software and tools that make it all possible. Then site helps developers quickly work through the basic concepts and then develop their first wearable app.
